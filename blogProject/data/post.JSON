        "a000":"Creating this blog was on my to-do list for today and I really am liking the layout so far. I still need to add the other pages and more posts but I think this is a really good start. As I continue learning, I will add more functionality like adding posts from the website instead of 'hard coding' them into the site. I think I will keep updating this site as I go and see what else I can add to it, it would be a good project for my portfolio in the future. I feel much more motivated and like I can actually stick to learning everything I need to this time. I have started in the past but this time it feels much easier to ick everything up that I want/need to in order to make the things I have in my head. I can't wait until I can start working on my idea for work. I think it will actually really be a great project to work on even if no one at my current job sees the value that I know it has. Now I sound like every tech bro who ever tech bro'd. Oh well, I think this post has gone on long enough, however it's funny that I just noticed I put it in the second post down instead of the first. Oh well, should give it some extra flavor."
