                        "Creating this blog was on my to-do list for today and I really am liking the
                        layout so far. I still need to add the other pages and more posts but I think
                        this is a really good start. As I continue learning, I will add more
                        functionality like adding posts from the website instead of 'hard coding'
                        them into the site. I think I will keep updating this site as I go and see
                        what else I can add to it, it would be a good project for my portfolio in the
                        future. I feel much more motivated and like I can actually stick to learning 
                        everything I need to this time. I have started in the past but this time it
                        feels much easier to ick everything up that I want/need to in order to make
                        the things I have in my head. I can't wait until I can start working on my
                        idea for work. I think it will actually really be a great project to work on
                        even if no one at my current job sees the value that I know it has. Now I
                        sound like every tech bro who ever tech bro'd. Oh well, I think this post has
                        gone on long enough, however it's funny that I just noticed I put it in the
                        second post down instead of the first. Oh well, should give it some extra flavor"
