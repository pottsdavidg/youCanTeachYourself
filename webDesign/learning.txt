I feel like I'm learning too slowly. 
There are a lot of things I need to cover very quickly if I want to get a job in a few months.
I did find a much more comprehensive guide to learning web development that I'm going to follow from here on out.
I think that focusing on getting those javascript projects up and running should be my top priority.
From here on out it's 100% focus on getting my programming practice.
I want to be able to freelance web dev while I work from home and that way I can go to school and make money while my school is being paid for.
Maybe even come up with something for OSU in the process to get my foot in the door or even build something that is very useful I could put on my resume for real world experience.
We will have to see. Over and out!
